## 🛋 Contributor Guidelines

- Use **single quotes** for all strings
- Keep code clean and modular (1 file = 1 concern)
- Include a commit message that’s descriptive but not overkill
- Add docs when you can, especially for new systems

---

## 🧸 Design Ethos

- Emotions > Efficiency
- Playfulness > Perfection
- Access > Aesthetic elitism
- Gentle > Generic

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Use Postman or curl for API routes
- Include testing examples if you add new features
- Manual testing is fine — we’ll add automation later
