# 🎮 bloom · Game Loop, XP & Rewards

This document outlines the XP system, dailies, dungeon mechanics, character growth, and how we gently turn real-life productivity into cozy game-like loops.

## 🔁 Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Wake up / open app**
2. **Check rituals / mood / tasks**
3. **Complete microtasks → gain XP**
4. **Level up → unlock rewards, customization**
5. **Spend coins on cosmetics, room decor, pet treats**
6. **Take on real-life dungeons (e.g. clean kitchen)**
7. **Get loot, cozy feedback, and visual progress**

## 💰 Currencies

| Type            | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ☕ **Beans**    | General currency for items, cosmetics            |
| 🎁 **Drops**    | Random rewards from dungeons                     |
| 🧪 **Boosters** | Buffs earned via streaks (e.g., +15% XP next 2h) |

---

## 🧱 Levels

- Players level up every 100 XP initially
- Every 5 levels unlock:
  - New cosmetics
  - New themes / audio packs
  - New cozy items (plants, mugs, pillows, etc.)
- Eventually unlock features (co-op dungeons, new pets)

---

## 🏰 Dungeons = Real-Life Challenges

> Real-life quests like "Deep clean my desk" or "File taxes"
> These become mini-journeys with progress markers.

### How it works:
- User creates a dungeon (multi-step task)
- Pick a vibe/setting (e.g., Haunted Closet, Tax Cave)
- Add sub-tasks as dungeon “floors”
- Completion shows:
  - 🎉 “You cleared this dungeon!”
  - 🏆 Bonus XP, Beans, Drops

Optional: co-op with friends 👯

## 🧘 Daily Rituals

| Ritual                                                                     | Notes                      |

| Stretch / hydrate / journal                                                | Based on user-defined list |
| Tracked like “daily quests”                                                | With streak bonuses        |
| Completion gives calm animation + XP + positive emoji reaction from avatar | 😌🌸                         |

| Dungeon streak | Completing 1 dungeon a day      |

- Dynamic quest board (daily and weekly)
- Visual growth: plants bloom, room brightens, avatar dances

## ✨ Soft XP Philosophy

> XP should feel gentle, achievable, and encouraging — not punishing.
> We don’t punish for skipping. We reward for blooming. 🌿
