## 🌱 Why Farming?

- Encourages **daily gentle actions**
- Adds a satisfying **visual metaphor for growth**
- Boosts reward systems (XP, drops, etc.)
- Makes care-for-self feel like care-for-plants 🌿

## 🌼 Core Loop

1. Plant a seed (🌱)
2. Water it once a day (💧)
3. See it grow (🪴)
4. Harvest it (🎁)
5. Get rewards (🧠 XP, 🌸 cosmetics, ☕ currency)
6. Start again

You can choose which “plot” to focus on each day (e.g., mental health, energy, mood)
