### 🐕 Core Pet Mechanics

| Feature             | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Adopt a pet         | User picks one from a cozy pixel list (cat, dog, bird, frog, etc.) |
| Mood sync           | Pet reflects how well you're doing (neglected? sleepy? glowing?)   |
| Feeding & care      | Simple actions to feed, pet, brush, or play                        |
| Nameable            | You name your pet and it sticks around forever 💖                  |
| Idle animations     | Sleeps, plays, walks around room                                   |
| Pet sound reactions | Purr, bark, chirp based on attention and streaks                   |
| Bonus XP            | Caring for pet gives soft XP & boosts your “wellness” stat         |
| Home screen         | Pet hangs out in your café/home base                               |
| Inventory & outfits | Unlock cosmetics for pets (hats, scarves, floaties 🐸)             |

### 🔄 Pet Emotions System

| Mood    | Triggered By                                  |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Happy   | Daily care, rituals completed, mood check-ins |
| Sleepy  | Ignored for a while (but not sad!)            |
| Playful | After a dungeon or active XP session          |
| Gloomy  | Long streak break or burnout mode             |
| Excited | When you earn a reward or hit a milestone     |
| Cuddly  | Random moments, or after journaling 📓        |

Pets are never angry. They’re gentle mirrors, not punishers 🌸

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 NPC SYSTEM

### 🌟 What are NPCs?
Fictional in-world characters who:
- Support you in soft, narrative-based ways
- Help teach features
- Offer encouragement, journal prompts, and emotion check-ins
- Can become closer friends over time

### 🎭 Relationship System (TBD)

- NPCs you interact with more often become “closer”

- “Pen Pal” feature (future): NPCs send you long-form encouragement emails or journals

## 🌱 Why It Matters

> These cozy beings make the app feel alive.
> They give care without demand. Encouragement without pressure.
> A reminder that small steps are always worth celebrating.

## 🧸 Future Ideas

- Multiple pets (with a little home menu or rotation system)
- Co-op pet play (your friends’ pets visit!)
- Seasonal pet events (e.g., sweater day, snowball play)
- NPC reactions to holidays, user mood history, or rituals

## ✨ NPC & Pet Philosophy

> You don’t need to impress anyone.
> You just need to be loved gently. And that’s what your pixel buddies are here for.
