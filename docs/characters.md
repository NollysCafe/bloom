# 🧍 bloom · Character & Avatar System

This document covers how users will interact with, customize, and care for their pixel avatar — a cozy, expressive reflection of themselves in the world of `bloom`.

---

## 💡 Purpose

- Provides a **gentle, expressive identity**
- Helps users **visualize their growth**
- Adds visual **feedback to actions** (dancing, sleeping, cheering, etc.)
- Feeds the **XP, fashion, farming, and pet systems**

## 🧠 Avatar Philosophy

> Your character isn’t about appearance.
> It’s about reflecting how you feel — and how you’re growing.

No gender, no pressure, no expectations — just ✨you✨, in pixel form.
