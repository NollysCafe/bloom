# 🌸 bloom · Code of Conduct

> “We’re not building a startup. We’re building a café.” ☕🌿

This project is a soft space.
It exists for neurodivergent brains, cozy creatives, overwhelmed minds, and gentle devs who want to make something kind and beautiful.

We want everyone to feel **welcomed, supported, and safe** — whether you're writing code, filing bugs, or vibing in the comments.

## 💖 Our Commitments

- We **listen with care**, not critique.
- We **assume positive intent** and give people time.
- We **don’t tolerate bigotry**, hate, or bullying — ever.
- We **move at the pace of clarity, not urgency**.
- We **believe in softness as a superpower**.

## 🧼 Expectations for All Contributors

- Use inclusive, welcoming language
- Be respectful of neurodivergent communication styles
- Don’t rush others (or yourself!)
- Avoid sarcasm, snark, or judgmental tone
- Ask before jumping in on someone’s work
- Uplift each other. Small wins are real wins 💫

## 🚫 Zero Tolerance

We will not allow:
- Harassment of any kind (in public or private)

## 🧃 Final Note

This is a **café**, not a competition.
We want to build with **boundaries, safety, softness, and care**.
If that sounds like you, welcome to `bloom`. 🌿✨
