## 🧘‍♀️ What is bloom?

> Ever had a free day — or even a free month — and yet felt stuck, overwhelmed, or frozen, endlessly scrolling on TikTok or Insta, unable to start anything on your mental to-do list?
> `bloom` is here to change that.

**bloom** is a cozy, gamified life planner for ADHD brains, neurodivergent minds, and anyone who just needs a little extra dopamine to get started.
It breaks down your goals into tiny, manageable steps — wrapped in soft UI, gentle soundscapes, pixel art characters, and RPG-style XP systems. 🌿
